## Abstract
### Background and Objective:
Helmet-Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (H-CPAP) is a non-invasive respiratory
support that is used for the treatment of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a severe medical condition
diagnosed when symptoms like profound hypoxemia, pulmonary opacities on radiography, or unexplained respiratory
failure are present. It can be classified as mild, moderate or severe. H-CPAP therapy is recommended as the initial
treatment approach for mild ARDS. Even though the efficacy of H-CPAP in managing patients with moderate-to-severe
hypoxemia remains unclear, its use has increased for these cases in response to the emergence of the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Using the electronic medical records (EMR) from the Pulmonology Department of Vimercate Hospital, in this study we
develop and evaluate a Machine Learning (ML) system able to predict the failure of H-CPAP therapy on ARDS patients.

### Methods:
The Vimercate Hospital EMR provides demographic information, blood tests, and vital parameters of
all hospitalizations of patients who are treated with H-CPAP and diagnosed with ARDS. This data is used to create
a dataset of 622 records and 38 features. Different ML models such as SVM, Fully-Connected Neural-Network, XGBoost, and Random Forest are iteratively trained in a cross-validation fashion. We also apply a feature selection algorithm to improve predictions quality and reduce the number of features.

### Results and Conclusions:
The SVM and Fully-Connected Neural-Network models proved to be the most effective, achieving final accuracies of 95.19% and 94.65%, respectively. In terms of F1-score, the models scored 88.61% and 87.18%. Additionally, the SVM and XGBoost models perform well with a reduced number of features (23 and 13, respectively). The PaO2/FiO2 Ratio, C-Reactive Protein, and O2 Saturation resulted as the most important features, followed by Heartbeats, WBCs, and D-Dimer, in accordance with the clinical scientific literature.
